The following CSS normalize/reset is a mish mash of Josh W. Comeau's (https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/), Matt Brictson's (https://mattbrictson.com/blog/css-normalize-and-reset) and sindresorhus' modern-normalise (https://github.com/sindresorhus/modern-normalize).


Other styling defaults not included, but that should be thought about (source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf0cjocP8Wk)

text length: 60 - 100 characters wide is best for reading and comprehension (74px)

Padding around text: At least 15px

Text size: MINIMUM 16px. Depending on font size. If font family is small, bump up to  18px or 20px.

Contrasts: Make sure text contrasts pass tests

Typefaces: Limit to 2 (or 3). Main body serif easier to read at small font size, san-serif for headers and sub-headers

Colors: Limit to two or three, not including shades (Brain trained to recognize a mash of colors as ads)

Icons: Label everything. People do NOT recognise icons. Try to limit to navigation/menu.
